 * @fileoverview
 * Declare a list of types that are the same as the generated protobuf types
 * except that we also bake in the knowledge of which properties are always
 * defined when they are queried from the RPCs. This allows us to limit type
 * casting to only where the data is queried instead of having to use non-null
 * coercion (i.e. `object.nullable!`) everywhere.
